# Brutal to the Bone

Brutalist theme purpose is to deliver minimum code needed to start out with [writteli](https://writte.li) page generation. If you've ever thought about creating own theme, then this is the place where you should begin.

## Page Slug !== Page Title

Take a look how the page is named (`title` param in this file) and how it looks like in page url (which is defined under `slug` param in this markdown file).
